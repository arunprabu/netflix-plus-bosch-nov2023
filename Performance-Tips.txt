ReactJS - Performace Tips
--
1. Use NPM package or any third party libraries only if absolutely needed.
2. Most performance issues come in lists. So, think about having pagination.
  Try this awesome package

3. Make use of props wisely. Don't leave out unused props. 
 
  So, a bad way could be...
  const MyComp = (props) => { //bad way if all props are not used

  }

  but a better way to have props is here.. using object destructuring.
  cont MyComp = ({ title, body, postId}){ // ignoring userId, if I don't display it anywhere

  }
  Also,don't pass unneccessary props. 

4. Lazy Load Images

5. Use profiler to record the app pages. And then check and fix the app. 
6. Think about optimizing back end also. 
7. Avoid having unnecessary tags, css. go with Fragment, <></>, 
9. Don't bloat the page with too many components, 
  because components will have re-rendering cycles.
  If one parent comp updates, that will update child comp's till the last level.
10. Don't create even a single class components. Use ONLY functional components. 
  Use hooks to stop child comp re-rendering. Remember useEffect, useCallback!
11. Don't write too many inline styles. You should definitely avoid it inside loops.
12. Don't write inline callbacks in loops. 
    // bad 
    <button onClick={() => deleteRecord()} >Delete</button> 
    // good 
    const deleteRecord = () =>{

    }
    <button onClick={deleteRecord} >Delete</button> 

13. Use Why did you update tool
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/@welldone-software/why-did-you-render
14. use useMemo, useCallback hooks
15. Learn more performance tips.. There are aplenty.
