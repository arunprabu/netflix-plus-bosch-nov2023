Webapps 
----
  1. Server Side Rendering Apps (SSR) / Traditional Webapps 
      * pages will refresh 

      Codebase 
      ----
        Front End (HTML, CSS, JS) + Back End (Java/PHP/etc) + DB Queries 

      Deployment 
      ----
        1 Server -- port 8080 
        
        http://localhost:8080

      Response: 
      ------
        HTML, CSS, JS + Data 

      Disadv 
      ----
        1. Slower Apps 
        2. One server has to do the heavy-lifting 
        3. UX was bad 
        4. bandwidth consumption was more 
        5. expensive

  2. Client Side Rendering Apps (CSR) / Modern Webapps = SPA + REST API 
      * Pages will NOT Refresh 

      Codebase 
      ----
        Front End App:  HTML, CSS, JS
        Back End App: Java/PHP/.... + DB Queries 

      Deployment 
      -----
        2 Servers 
          1 For Front End App a.k.a Single Page App (SPA)  -- port 3000
          Response: HTML, CSS, JS 

          1 For Back End App a.k.a RESTful API (Rest API)  -- port 8080
          Response: Data (JSON) 

      Advantages 
      ----
        1. Faster Apps 
        2. Two servers are sharing the workload
        3. UX has become good
        4. bandwidth consumption was less 
        5. less expensive


--------
Single Page Apps (SPA)
----
  Characteristics of SPA
    1. Page should NOT Refresh 
    2. URL should change 
    3. History should be maintained w/o page refresh 
    4. Header and Footer should not be loaded again and again 
    5. In Between Header and Footer -- show the contextual updates 
    6. Active Menu should be set 
    7. Page Title should be changed 

  Frameworks / Libraries
  ---------
    #1. React JS (library)
    #2. Angular 2+ (framework)
    #3. Vue JS (framework)

=====
Component
-----------
  Thinking in React 
    Step 0: Identify the number of components 
    Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy 

  Types of Components 
  ------
    1. Functional Components
        * were called as Stateless Components. But no longer.
        * were called as Presentational components / Dumb Components.  But no longer

        1.1. Functional Components with Named Fn [DONE]
        1.2. Functional Components with Anonymous Fn [DONE]
        1.3. Functional Components with Arrow Fn [DONE] (RECOMMENDED)

    2. Class Components (About to be Deprecated in v19 or v20)
        * were called as Stateful Components. But no longer.
        * were called as Containers components / Smart Components.  But no longer

Naming Conventions & Casing 
----
  Casing Types 
  --------
    1. PascalCase 
        * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
        * also Recommended for Interface in TypeScript 
        * Recommended for React Components and the folder of Components

        examples 
        ---
          class CarDetails {

          }

          interface Employee {

          }

    2. camelCase 
        * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
        * Recommended for id's of html elements 
        * Recommended for variables, const, fn, methods, event handlers of React Component
        
        examples 
        -----
          var myCar = 'BMW';
          var isLoggedIn = true;

          function getCarInfo() {
            //....
          }
    
    3. kebab-case
        * Recommended for URLs 
        * Recommended for file names, folder names, assets in front end projects  
        * Recommended for css classes 
        * okay for id's of html elements if your architect says ok

        examples 
        -----
          btn-primary
          slideshow-container 
          youtube-logo.png 

    4. snake_case 
        * never ever use this. 
        * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

        examples
        ---
          const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;
